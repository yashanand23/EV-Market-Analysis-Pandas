Scatter plots revealed a clustering of affordable EVs with moderate ranges.
Bar plots highlighted dominant sales contributions by specific manufacturing locations.

7. Advanced Analysis
- Tasks Completed:
  - Grouped data by Brand and Manufacturing Location:
Found average metrics for Range, Price, and Efficiency.
  - Categorized Price into Budget, Mid-range, and Luxury tiers using pd.cut():
  - Performed tier-specific analyses.
Identified top EV models based on their Value_Score.
   - Analyzed time-based trends (e.g., sales over years) and plotted efficiency distributions.
#### Key Insight:
- Budget-tier EVs showed the highest sales volume, indicating demand for affordable options.
- Luxury EVs often exhibited the highest Value_Scores due to superior range and efficiency.
#### Overall Insights and Key Findings
###### EV Market Trends:

- Budget-friendly EVs dominate sales, while luxury models cater to a niche audience.
- Brands focusing on manufacturing location efficiency see higher market shares.
- Price vs. Performance:
Moderate correlation between range and price, showing diminishing returns at higher price points.

- Efficiency Analysis:
High-efficiency models often belong to premium brands or newer manufacturing facilities.

- Time-Based Insights:Sales have steadily increased over time, with notable spikes for models offering high Value_Scores.

- Best Performers: Top brands have a balanced approach to pricing, range, and efficiency.

### Challenges and Solutions
##### Challenges:
- Handling missing values and duplicates in the dataset.
- Integrating data from multiple sources with different structures.

## Conclusion
This project comprehensively explores the electric vehicle (EV) market using advanced data manipulation and analysis techniques in Python. Through efficient use of Pandas and visualizations, we uncovered key insights into the relationships between pricing, range, efficiency, and sales performance of EVs. The analysis revealed the following highlights:

Efficiency and Value: High-efficiency vehicles often correlate with increased sales, especially when combined with competitive pricing. The derived Value_Score further emphasized models that strike a balance between range, efficiency, and price.

Brand Performance: Some brands dominate in sales due to better manufacturing locations and superior features. Grouped analyses of sales by manufacturing locations provided insights into the geographical factors influencing success.

Price Segmentation: Categorizing EVs into Budget, Mid-range, and Luxury tiers revealed a diverse market appeal. Each price category had distinct sales drivers, from affordability to luxury features.

Exploratory Insights: Through statistical summaries and visualizations, we identified trends such as the impact of efficiency on sales, pricing variations across brands, and market share distributions. Box plots and bar plots provided deeper insights into the spread and concentration of key variables.


This project serves as a detailed guide for understanding the EV market dynamics and applying data-driven strategies to improve product offerings and marketing approaches. Potential future work could include incorporating time-series data for sales trends, analyzing customer reviews for sentiment analysis, or studying the impact of government incentives on EV adoption.
